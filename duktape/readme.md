
*Please note:*

The files `duk_config.h`, `duktape.c`, and `duktape.h`
are the required release files of the Duktape project.
Version, license and authors are included in `duktape.c`,
The open source license is identical to the license of
this `duktape-cc` c++ header library project.

Initially the release files were separately downloaded
and extracted from the `tar.xz` archive when invoking
`make`, but unfortunately people keep having trouble
with wget, tar and xz on Windows.
